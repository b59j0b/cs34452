Term   Project   and   Homework   Assignments
Returns   to   Education
ECON   4400
1            OverviewHuman capital, defined as the   skills, knowledge,   and   abilities that   an   individual   possesses,   has   been   a   focal   point   of economic research   in   labor,   development,   and political   economy—to   name   a   few.    Education   and   job   training   are   important human   capital   investments,   leading   to higher   earnings   and   non-pecuniary bene-   fits.   Your   ECON   4400 project   focuses   on   the   former.   You   will   quantify   the   returns   to   education,   estimating the   effect   of a   year   of schooling   on   an   individual’s   wage.    While   economics   has   developed   sound   theoret-   ical   foundations, empirical   work   on   the   return   to   human   capital   has   been   at   the   center   of   considerable   debate.As   part   of   your   project, you   will   explore   a   part   of   that   debate   by   replicating   (approximately, I   have   simplified the   analysis   to   a   degree)   the   results   of   Angrist   and   Krueger   (1991) using   the   2022   American   Community Survey   (ACS).   I   chose   this   approach   to   foster   critical   thinking   and   deepen   econometric   knowledge.    Our   analysis   will   also   draw   upon   Bound,   Jaeger,   and   Baker’s   (1995)   critique   of   the   instrumental   variables   ap-   proach   used   in   Angrist   and   Kreuger   (1991).    You   are   therefore   required   to   read   both   papers,   Angrist   and   Krueger   (1991) and   Bound, Jaeger, and   Baker   (1995).   I   have   posted   papers   on   our   Carmen   course   site   Mod-   ules   page   under   “Articles   for   Term   Project”   .Throughout   the   term,   you   will   complete   parts   of the   analysis   and   submit   each   component   as   a   homework   assignment.   In   doing   so, I   can   assist   with   your   learning   of   econometrics   in   practice.   Additionally, the   home-   work assignments enable me to address issues with coding or   analysis.For   each   assignment,   you   need   only   to   submit   what   is   requested.    You   will   include   the   tables   created   for   each   assignment   with   your   term project.    A homework   assignment   will   also   ask you   to   introduce,   discuss,   and   explain   particular   sections   of   your   term   project, e.g., data, regression   analysis, results,   and   econometric methodologies.   After I return the assignment, you   should edit   and   expand the   section   following   the   outline   below, addressing any notes or needed   corrections.You   will   analyze   the   returns   to   education   in   a   U.S.   state.       Refer   to   Table      1   to   see   your   assigned   state.   To   download   your   data   file,   log   on   to   Carmen,   go   to   Modules,   scroll   toward   the   bottom   of the   page,   and   download the state data file   assigned   to   you.
2          Paper   Requirements   and   ExpectationsYou will write a three to   six page   analysis   (not   including   tables   and   can   be   longer   if needed)   on   the   returns   to   education   and   submit   it   at   the   beginning   of   class   on   Friday,   04/18.    The   paper   will   include   two   tables:    a   table   of   summary   statistics   and   returns   to   education   estimates   (see   Sections   3.1,   3.2,   and   3.3.    You   need   to attach   your   do-file   with   the   paper.    If you   do   not   submit   a   working   do-file,   you   will   receive,   at   most,   half credit for this assessment.
Your   do-file   needs   to   be   cleaned   of any   redundant   or   incorrect   commands.    The   entire   do-file   needs   to   be   executable.   In other words, if you click the execute icon, Stata executes every   command   without   error.Your write-up   of the   analysis   should follow the below   general   outline–the   sub-items   do   not   need   to   follow   the   stated order.   You must address each enumerated   item but   can   include   additional   background   or   support   as   needed.   Your   writing   needs   to   flow   (does   not   read   as   an   itemized   list), and   each   paragraph   must   consist   of one   key   idea   with   supportive   statements   (evidence, results, etc.)    about   that   key   idea.   You   must   also   ensure your writing includes transitions between key ideas (paragraphs).
1.    Introduction
(a)    Discuss   the   importance   and   benefit   of   education   in   the   context   of   earnings.    For   background,   read the following papers:
•    “Economic   returns   to   education:    What   We   Know,   What   We   Don’t   Know,   and   Where   We Are   Going–Some   Brief   Pointers” by   Dickson   and   Harmon   (2011)
•    “Does   Compulsory    School   Attendance   Affect   Schooling   and   Earnings”   by   Angrist   and   Krueger   (1991)
•    “Educational   Attainment   and   Quarter   of   Birth:   A   Cautionary   Tale   of   LATE” by   Barua   and Lang   (2008)
•    “Problems With   Instrumental   Variables Estimation When   the   Correlation   Between   the   In-   struments   and   the   Endogenous   Explanatory   Variable   is   Weak” by   Bound, Jaeger, and   Baker   (1995)
You can   access the papers in the   module Articles   for   Term Project   on   our   Carmen   course   site’s   Modules page.
2.    Data   and   Methodology
(a)    Cite   and   discuss   the   data   used   for   the   analysis
(b)    Discuss   the   sub-samples   used   for   the   analysis, referencing   the   summary   statistics
3.    Returns   to   Education
(a)    Introduce   and   discuss   the   wage   equation (b)    Discuss   OLS   return   to   education
(c)    Discuss   why   the   OLS   estimate   for   the   return   to   education   is   biased
(d)    Discuss   Two   Stage   Least   Squares   (2SLS) estimator–how   does   it   address   the   endogeneity   prob-   lem?
(e)    Discuss   the   instrumental   variables, including   the   relevancy   and   validity   requirements   (f)    Discuss   the   2SLS   return   to   education
(g)    How   do   your   results   compare   to   Angrist   and   Krueger   (1991).   Specifically,   do   your   results   com-   port   with   the   authors’ findings   for   the   30-39   and   40-49   cohorts?
(h)    Compare   and   discuss   OLS   versus   2SLS   estimates.    Do   the   result   meet   expectations?    Explain   (Hint:   why   is   the   OLS   estimator   of   the   returns   to   education   biased?)   Discuss   the   F-statistic   from the test for weak instruments.   What insights does the test provide regarding the results?

3          Homework:   Putting   Together   Your   Analysis
3.1          Homework   1, Due   Friday, 02/07Overview of   assignment and what you will submit:   You will generate a table reporting summary statistics   of   various samples and write one to three paragraphs summarizing and comparing economic variables across   different groups.   We will compare multiple   samples   of individuals   of various   age   groups,   who reported   an   income   in   2021.   The   focus   of   the   write-up   needs   to   be   on   composition   of   the   samples   relative   to   others.   You want   to   focus   you   write   up   of   how   the   sample   of   respondents   between   the   ages   30   to   39   and   40   to   49   year olds   compare   to   one   another   as   well   to   those   between   the   ages   25   and   64.
You   will   submit   a   paper   copy   of your   write-up   with   the   summary   statistics   table   and   a   print-out   of your   do-file   at   the   beginning   of   class   on   Friday, 02/07.
What   to   Submit   - three   items:
1.    A   write-up   discussing   the   data   source,   the   samples,   and   summary   statistics.       (I   have   included      an example   of   a   write-up   of   summary   statistics   below   Table   2 for   reference.)
2.    A   table   of   summary   statistics, created   using   Word   or   Excel.
3.    Attach   a   printout   of   your   do-file   (the   entire   document)Instructions:   You will generate summary statistics for four   subsamples.   The   first   subsample   consists   of all   wage   and   salary   workers   and   self-employed   individuals   between   the   ages   of   25   and   64   who   report   a   2021   income   (the   2022 ACS   reports   income   from   the   prior   year).   The   second   sample   restricts   the   first   one   to   only wage   and   salary   workers   between   the   ages   25 and   64.   The   third   subsample   is   comprised   of   wage   and   salary workers between   the   ages   30   and   39.    The   fourth   subsample   consists   of wage   and   salary   workers between   the   ages   40 and   49.   We   will   use   the   latter   two   samples   to   estimate   the   returns   to   education.Your   first   homework   assignment   will   require   you   to   complete   a   process   known   as   data   cleaning.   Researchers often   need   to   recode   or   generate   new   variables   from   survey   data.      The   below   commands   will   walk   you   through how to “clean ACS data” to estimate   the   returns   to   education   and   the   probability   that   an   individual   participates in the labor force.
The   task   of data   cleaning   is   often   an   arduous   one.    To   cultivate   command-based   coding   and   data   analytics   skills using Stata, I am providing all the code for this portion   of the project.In   Stata   to   indicate   a   range,   e.g.,   tabulate   incwage   between   20,000   and   40,000,   i.e.,   20,   000   ≤ incwage   ≤   40,   000,   the   code   is tab    incwage    if    incwage>=20000            incwage<=40000.   Suppose   you   want   a   “or”   statement,   use    |   .       For   example,   you   want   a   count   of   respondents   who   are   married:      count    if   marst==1      |    marst==2, where a value   of one indicates   a married   person   and   two   indicates   married but   separated   (for   assigned   values   and   designations   regarding   marital   status:    label    list      marst_lbl).   The   vertical   line   |   denotes   “or” and    denotes   “and”   in   Stata.It is best practice to describe (label) newly generated variables.   It will   describe   the   variable   enabling   you   to   determine what it represents or measures when referring back to it.   I am leaving variable   labeling   to   you.   It   is   not   something   you   need   to   do, but   it   may   be   helpful   later   in   the   term.
label      var    variable_name    "Description   "To begin,upload your assigned data into Stata (Note:   If you copy the   Stata   code from   this   PDF,   some   characters may not correctly reproduce onto the do-file.   If   you receive an error message   after   execut-   ing   your   do-file, check   whether   an   incorrectly   copied   character   is   the   source.):
use      path/acs_2022_X   .dta,    clear
where path   denotes   the   directory   path   where   the   data   file   is   saved   on   your   computer.    The   “X”   is   a   place   holder   for   the   State   FIP   code, e.g., if   assigned   California, the   State   FIP   code   is   6.
Define the sample:We   need   to   define   the   appropriate   subsamples   for   analysis.    On   your   project   do-file,   type   or   copy   the   fol-   lowing commands   and execute the   file.    (Note:   It is best practice   when   first   using   Stata   to   ensure   each   new   command is executable before moving onto the next )
Keep   all   observations   between   the   ages   of   25   and   64.   keep      if      age>=25            age<=64
Keep   all   wage   and   salary   workers   and   self-employed   respondents.    (Reminder:    the   vertical   line   is   read   as   “or”)
keep    if    classwkr==1         |       classwkr==2
Keep all wage and   salary workers   and   self-employed respondents   who   report   working   on   average   35   hours   or   more   hours   per   week.
